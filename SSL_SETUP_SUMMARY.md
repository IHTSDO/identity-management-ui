# SSL Setup Summary - Identity Management UI

## âœ… Completed Configuration

Your nginx configuration has been successfully updated to support SSL on port 8092 for the Identity Management UI.

### What Was Updated

1. **SSL Certificates Generated**
   - Self-signed certificate for `local.ihtsdotools.org`
   - Certificate location: `/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/local.ihtsdotools.org.crt`
   - Private key location: `/usr/local/etc/ssl/private/local.ihtsdotools.org.key`

2. **Nginx Configuration Enhanced**
   - Updated existing 8092 server block to support SSL
   - Added SSL protocols (TLS 1.2 and 1.3)
   - Added security headers
   - Enhanced proxy configuration for Angular dev server
   - Added WebSocket support for hot reload
   - Added static asset caching

3. **SSL Security Features**
   - Modern SSL ciphers
   - Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
   - Content Security Policy
   - Proper proxy headers for HTTPS

### Current Configuration

Your application is now accessible at:
- **HTTPS URL**: `https://local.ihtsdotools.org:8092`
- **Redirect URI for Keycloak**: `https://local.ihtsdotools.org:8092/*`

### Keycloak Integration

With this SSL setup, your Keycloak client configuration should include:
```
Valid Redirect URIs:
- https://local.ihtsdotools.org:8092/*
- https://local.ihtsdotools.org:8092
```

### Next Steps

1. **Start Angular Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access Your Application**
   - Visit `https://local.ihtsdotools.org:8092`
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser

3. **Test Keycloak Authentication**
   - The application should now redirect to Keycloak properly
   - After authentication, you should be redirected back to the application

### Files Modified

- `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - Main nginx configuration
- `/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/local.ihtsdotools.org.crt` - SSL certificate
- `/usr/local/etc/ssl/private/local.ihtsdotools.org.key` - SSL private key

### Backup

Your original nginx configuration has been backed up to:
- `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Certificate Warnings**: Accept the self-signed certificate in your browser
2. **Port Conflicts**: Check if port 8092 is available with `sudo lsof -i :8092`
3. **Nginx Issues**: Check nginx error logs with `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
4. **Configuration**: Test nginx config with `sudo nginx -t`

The SSL setup is now complete and ready for Keycloak authentication!
